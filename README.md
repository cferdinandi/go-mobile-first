# Go Mobile First
Go Mobile First is a mobile-first boilerplate for WordPress.

This style-light theme is ready to use right out of the box, but I've also added lots of comments throughout the code so that you can easily modify to suit your needs.

**Version: 1.5**

## What is mobile-first?
Mobile-first is an approach to web design that's kind of like graceful degredation in reverse. You start with a collection of basic styles that work on all browsers (including older browsers and not-so-smart phones), and then add progressive enhancements for more capable browers/devices and bigger screens.

While this theme is deliberately lightweight, you should also take some [additional steps to improve the performance of your site](http://gomakethings.com/how-to-trick-out-the-performance-of-your-wordpress-site/).

## What does it look like?
Go Mobile First is a modified version of [Go Make Things](http://gomakethings.com).

It includes a fluid single column layout, responsive text, and a collapsing navigation menu on smaller screens for browsers that support it.

## Powered by HTML5
This theme makes use of the new HTML5 semantics. If you're not familiar with them, you might want to familiarize yourself. ["Dive Into HTML5" by Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html) is a good place to start.

## Included Styles

### Colors
Go Mobile First uses a simple, muted color palette. Colors were chosen for their high-contrast and accessibility for color blind individuals.

Feel free to customize as you see fit (you might want to use the free [Color Oracle app](http://colororacle.org/) to check for accessibility).
