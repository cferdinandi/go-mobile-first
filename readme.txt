A mobile-first starter theme for WordPress by Chris Ferdinandi

Go Mobile First is a mobile-first starter theme for WordPress.
This isn't a framework. Actually, it's the opposite of a framework.
I've removed as much as possible, so you have a simple, clean
foundation to build on. I've added lots of comments to make things
as easy for you as possible. Enjoy!



* WHAT IS MOBILE-FIRST? *

Mobile-first is an approach to web design that's kind of like
graceful degredation in reverse. You start with a collection of
basic styles that work on all browsers (including older browsers and
not-so-smart phones), and then add progressive enhancements for
more capable browers/devices and bigger screens.

While this theme is deliberately lightweight, you should also
take some additional steps to improve the performance of your site.

* POWERED BY HTML5 *

This theme makes use of the new HTML5 semantics. If you're not familiar with them,
you might want to familiarize yourself. "Dive Into HTML5" by Mark Pilgrim is a
good place to start. http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html
